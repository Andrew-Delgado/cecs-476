This project is about disk quotas.
On the machine you administer.
Set up user quotas (version 2) on your hard drive. Specifically, set up only user quotas; do not set up group
qoutas.
Give bob a quota of one megabyte of disk space. Quota is calculated in blocksize, so run dumpe2fs on your
filesystem if you aren’t sure.
Do not put any limit on his quota of inodes.
Testing: as bob, try to copy in ~djv/etherboot.img. (There is nothing special about this file, it’s just a
big file that is also used for something else.) You should get a ”Disk quota exceeded message”.
Report:


1) A summary of the steps you took to set up quotas. That is, what commands did you issue and in what
order.

echo "ln -s /dev/sda2 /dev/root" >> /etc/rd.d/rc.S
reboot
edquota bob

2) The modified line from fstab.

/dev/sda2        /                 ext2       usrquota         1   1

3) The quota entry for bob as displayed by edquota.

quotacheck: Cannot guess format from filename on /dev/root. Please specify format on commandline.

4) The size of the etherboot.img file in ~djv and the size of the etherboot.img in ~bob.

~djv/etherboot.img = 1.5M
etherboot.img in bob = 860K
