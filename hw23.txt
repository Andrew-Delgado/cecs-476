This project is about SAMBA.
1) Create a directory /home/share on your machine and create a couple text files in it. Call them sam.txt
and joe.txt.

mkdir share
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Modify the samba configuration file so that your security is by share and you share the /home/share
directory as public read only. Call this share [myshare]. (Yes, you’ll need to do a few other housekeeping
items.) Also, turn off the printer shares and anything you are not really offering.

[myshare]
   path = /net/cheetah/u3/c/csa476/y1/share
   public = yes
   writable = no
   printable = no
   create mask = 0765
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Set up the rc file (rc.samba) so it is executable. (You disabled it if you followed the instructions during
the install project.) Run rc.samba. If you have already started samba (and it didn’t work right), rc.samba
has start, stop and restart as parameters. Once you have started samba, check to make sure the two samba
daemons are running. If they are not, check the log files for messages.

chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.samba
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Test your configuration: Go to a Windows machine in the lab (windows laptops may also work, but not
guarenteed). Login with your campus account. Open an explorer window (or My Computer). Use the
syntax “\\134.139.248.xx\myshare” where “xx” is the last octet of your machine’s IP address (refer to the
IP numbers on the front of your machine or use the ifconfig command). You may only do this from on
campus in the CECS labs (your share will not be exposed to the internet).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstration: Before you submit, you must use a windows machine to demonstrate that your share works.
Please leave samba running so that your instructor can test the share as well.
Submit: Your assignment as hw23.txt. It should contain a copy of your smb.conf with the comments
removed (appended if you wish).
grep "^[^#;]" smb.conf

smbclient //lab71/myshare -N -c ls
