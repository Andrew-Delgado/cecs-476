Suddenly, the machine which you are assigned to administer, contains an empty hard drive. (When you are
ready to do this project, let me know and write your lab machine number on the board so I can “clean”
your machine’s hard drive.)

Configure the machine according to the attached build page (VERY carefully). If you don’t include the
correct software, later projects won’t work.. If you botch the network configuration, your home directories
won’t be available.

Do not configure the sdb drive, that will be done by students next semester (if you want, you can wipe the
drive to make things cleaner).

The root password should be set to the same as before.
Once you have configured the system, create one local user (called bob) with the password we’ve used on
him before. Don’t forget his home directory.

Report: Boot from the hard drive. Login with your csa476xx account, run ls to make sure your home
directory is there. Then run df, and report the amount disk free on on all of your mounts. This report
submission (in addition to the one line df) should contain your machine name. (Note: for the final, you
REALLY want to know the steps of the install; for the report, all I want is to verify the install worked.
SAVE YOUR NOTES ABOUT THE INSTALL!)
