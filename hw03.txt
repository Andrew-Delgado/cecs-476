command: "cd /etc" //this gets us to the directory where passwd is stored

command: "vipw -p" this will edit the passwd file

I edited the passwd file with inserting these two lines

"bob:x:13101:1201:cecsu:/home/bob:/bin/bash"
"sue:x:13102:1202:cecsg:/home/sue:/bin/bash"

I then had to create the /home/bob directories //same for sue

command:"mkdir ~bob" //this will create //home/bob as the home directory

chmod 755 ~bob //sets the home directory permissions //same as sue

Then to find and copy the ".bash_profile" and ".login" from ~djv account

command:"cp ~" + tab // this will find all files that start with "~"

command:"cp ~djv/.bash_profile ~djv/.login /home/bob" //same for sue

we then need to create a demo file do this from root with "vim demo"


command:"chown -R bob:1201 /home/bob" //To change ownership of groups of home and content to the user
